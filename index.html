<h1>Mom's Okay Spaghetti</h1>
<h2>It's not horrible™️ </h2>
<p> This is my mom's famous spaghetti. It is not authentic and some might</br>
argue that it is not "good". But you know what? It's Not Horrible™️. And </br>
that's on Chef Boyardee. Boy, this stuff is alright.
</p>
</br>
Here's what you'll need:
</br>
<ul>
    <li>1 Gallon of ketchup</li>
    <li>Hot Dogs</li>
    <li>Noodles (any kind is alright)</li>
    <li>Hot Cheetos</li>

</ul>
